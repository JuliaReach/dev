**Context.** In our organization we use different tools to develop the work. This file describes the main tools that are used and also lists some of the best practices to use them effectively.

## Github

The JuliaReach libraries are hosted on github (free version), hence every contributor needs to have an account.
There is a time budget for running CI on open source projects that we have never reached it so far.

## Google Calendar

We have a team calendar to notify others when there are meetings. The procedure to use the JuliaReach team calendar is:

1) Create a session using your personal user as you would normally do.
2) Invite guests that your are interested to join, but also invite `juliareach.dev@gmail.com`. Then the new session should appear in the team calendar (after manually accepting the session from juliareach).

## HackMD

We have a space to share team notes in HackMD: https://hackmd.io/team/juliareach << forbidden?

## Quire

We have a private JuliaReach project under https://quire.io . This is mostly used for projects. 

## Gitlab

We have some old projects on gitlab. We also have a repository of references (articles, books, theses) there.

## Zulip

There is a public stream called `reachability-analysis`, also a private one `juliareach-dev`. There is another private channel called `juliareach-days` to organize the meetups.

## Gitter

We have been using gitter since the beginning, however, nowaydays zulip is more active.

## Slack

There is no slack channel for JuliaReach or reachability analysis.

## VSCode

VSCode is great.
