**Context.** In our organization we use different tools to develop the work. This file describes the main tools that are used and also lists some of the best practices to use them effectively.

## Google Calendar

Procedure to use the JuliaReach team calendar:

1) Create a session using your personal user as you would normally do.
2) Invite guests that your are interested to join, but also invite `julireach.dev@gmail.com`. Then the new session should appear in the team calendar.

The second step requires manual intervention to accept the meeting in the juliareach account, but since we have low traffic we don't need to automate it.
